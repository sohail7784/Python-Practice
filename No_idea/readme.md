The goal of this problem is to calculate your total happiness level based on a list of numbers and your personal preferences. You are given an array of integers and two special sets: 
Set A: The numbers you like.
Set B: The numbers you dislike & 
If the number is in Set A (you like it), you gain +1 happiness.
If the number is in Set B (you dislike it), you lose -1 happiness.
If the number isn't in either set, your happiness doesn't change
